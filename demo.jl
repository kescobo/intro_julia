# ## Some Basic Syntax
#
# A lot of these examples were taken or adapted from [Learn julia in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/)
#
# ### Numbers and math
#
# numbers work like numbers, with common infix operators:

2 + 2
#-
(1 + 2) * 6
#-
12 % 5

# Dividing integers always produces `Float`s

15 / 5
#-
15 / 6

# One can use `div()` to truncate,
# or use `//` for rational numbers

div(3, 2)
#-
3//2

# ### Boolean operators
#
# The boolean operators in julia are `true` and `false`. `!` is used for `not`

# Boolean operators
!true
#-
!false
#-
1 == 1
#-
1 != 1
#-
1 < 10
#-
1 >= 10

# Comparisons can be chained

1 < 2 < 3
#-
2 < 3 < 2

# ### Variable assignment
#
# Assign variables with `=`.
# Variables must start with a letter, but can contain letters, numbers, `_` and `!`.
# Many unicode characters can also be used (though some are already taken)

x = 5
üëç = 2x + 7 # type \:+1:<tab>

println(x)
println(üëç)
println(‚ÑØ) # type \euler<tab>
println(œÄ) # type \pi<tab>

# ### Strings
#
# Strings must be surrounded by double quotes (`"`).
# Single quotes (`'`) are reserved for character literals.
# String interpolation can be accomplished with `$`,
# and concatenation with   `*`

typeof("S")
#-
typeof('S')
#-
println("x is $x" * " and " * "‚ÑØ is $‚ÑØ")

# ## Loops, functions, collections
#
# Mostly, whitespace is ignored.
# Newlines are sometimes reqired (or can be indicated with `;`).
# Code blocks are identified with keywords and `end`.
#
# The following are equivalent:

function foo(x, y)
    return 2x + y
end

function foo(x, y); return 2x+y; end

function foo(    x,y    )
return 2x + y
end

# or

for i in 1:2:10
    if i < 5
        println(i)
    end
end

for i in 1:2:10; if i<5; println(i); end; end

# Though the style convention is to indent inner blocks.
#
# A shorter form for function invocation is also possible:

foo(x, y) = 2x + y

foo(2.3, 5)

# ### N-dimensional arrays are taken very seriously
#
# Default julia arrays are column major,
# though there are packages that enable different behavior

one_d = [1, 2, 3, 0]
#-
two_d = [1 10 2 20; # note: newlines aren't actually necessary
         3 30 0 0]
#-

three_d = reshape(collect(1:16), 4,2,2)

# "Dot" syntax can be used for broadcasting,
# other operators assume matrix operations.

three_d .^ 2
#-
two_d * one_d

# ### Indexing
#
# Julia uses 1-based indexing (though there are packages that can adjust this)

one_d[4]
#-
two_d[1, 2:3] # first row, columns 2 to 3
#-
three_d[2:end, :, 1] # rows 2 to the end, all columns, 1st z

# Initialize arrays and update, use comprehensions, or grow them from empty
# (note: it's customary for functions that mutate any of their arguments to end with `!`)

a1 = zeros(3,2)
a1[4] = 3
a1[3,2] = 6
a1
#-
a2 = [‚àöx for x in 1:5] # or sqrt(x) or x^-2
#-
a3 = []
for i in 10:-2:0
    push!(a3, i)
end
a3

# ## Julia's Type System
#
# This is complicated,
# but [the docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/types/) are suprisingly readable.
#
# Julia's magic (at least a big part of it) is its type dispatch system.
# Everything from functions to scalars have a concrete type,
# and one or more parent abstract types.

typeof(a1) |> println
typeof("Hi!") |> println
typeof(String) |> println
#-
String <: AbstractString
#-
String <: Number
#-
typeof(2.2) <: Float64
#-
Float64 <: AbstractFloat <: Real <: Number
#-
subtypes(AbstractFloat)
#-
subtypes(Number)
#-
typeof(complex(2.2)) <: Real
#-

# Everything is a subtype of `Any`

supertype(Number)
#-
supertype(AbstractString)
#-
supertype(Any)

# Functions dispatch on the types of all of their arguments (most specific first).
# This example is from a [blog post](https://white.ucc.asn.au/2018/10/03/Dispatch,-Traits-and-Metaprogramming-Over-Reflection.html)
# by Lyndon White.
# I made a couple modifications, but it's mostly his work.

display_percent(x) = println(100x, "%")

# When arguments do not have type assertion, they default to `Any`.
# In other words, the above is equivalent to:

display_percent(x::Any) = println(100x, "%")
#-
display_percent(0.5) # Float64
display_percent(0.5f0) # Float32
display_percent(BigFloat(œÄ)/10) # BigFloat
display_percent(1) # Int64
display_percent(false) # Bool
display_percent(2//3) # Rational

# To get the `Rational` result to display a bit better,
# we can write a more specialized method.
# Julia's dispatch system will attempt to call the most specific method possible.

function display_percent(x::Rational)
    x = round(100x, digits=2)
    println(x, "%")
end

display_percent(2//3)

# What about something that's already a String?
# The generic method above fails, since `100 * ::String` isn't defined.

try
    display_percent("23.0%")
catch e
    showerror(stdout, e)
end

# But we can fix that.

function display_percent(str::AbstractString) # could do ::String, but nice to be as generic as possible
    if !occursin(r"^\d*\.?\d+%?$", str)  # any combination of numbers, followed or not by a percent sign
        throw(DomainError(str, "Not valid percentage format"))
    end

    if endswith(str, "%")
        println(str)
    else
        println("$str%")
    end
end

display_percent("1.2")
display_percent("42%")

# Where this really comes in handy
# is working with things you as the programmer don‚Äôt know the type of
# when you are writing the code.
# For example if you have a hetrogenous list of elements to process.

for x in [0.51, 0.6, 1//2, 0.1, "2%", "15"]
    display_percent(x)
end

# A real world example of this sort of code
# is in [solving for indexing rules in TensorFlow.jl][1].
#
# [1]: https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl/blob/d7ac7e306ca95122c2583c9db06f9e7405102275/src/ops/indexing.jl#L69-L98

# It is also nicely extensible. Lets say we created a singleton type to represent a half.

struct Half end

display_percent(::Half) = println("50%")

display_percent(Half())

# So it was simple to just add a new method for it.
# Users can add support for new types,
# completely separate from the original definition.
#
# Constrast it to:

function display_percent_bad(x)
     if x isa AbxactString
         if !occursin(r"^\d*\.?\d+%?$", x)
             throw(DomainError(x, "Not valid percentage format"))
         end

         if endswith(x, "%")
             println(x)
         else
             println("$x%")
         end
    else
        println(100x, "%")
    end
end

display_percent_bad("5.3%")
display_percent_bad(0.5)

try
    display_percent_bad(Half())
catch e
    showerror(stdout, e)
end

# You can see, that since it doesn‚Äôt include support for Half when it was declared,
# it doesn‚Äôt work.
# One could add to the conditional, but that's harder to find and debug later.
# In addition, if a user wants to write a new type that uses this method,
# they'd have to modify the original code.
#
# This kinda code is common in a fair bit of python code.
#
# ## Some basic data wrangling
#
# There are a number of ways to work with tabular data in julia.
# A common package is `DataFrames`.

using DataFrames
using RDatasets, GLM, Statistics

iris = dataset("datasets", "iris")
head(iris)
#-
unique(iris[:Species])
#-
by(iris, :Species) do df
    DataFrame(
        Petal_Œº = mean(df[:PetalLength]),
        Petal_œÉ = std(df[:PetalLength])
        )
end
#-

lm1 = lm(@formula(SepalLength ~ SepalWidth + PetalLength), iris)
#-

using Plots
